## Argonne National Laboratory Lemont, IL, USA

- POSTDOCTORAL APPOiNTEE iN THE MATHEMATiCS AND COMPUTER SCiENCE DiViSiON Jul. 2020 ‑ present
  - Collaborated with plasma physicists to design a combined MLP/CNN model to reconstruct plasma equilibrium images and physical quantities; implemented using Pytorch; achieved 1000x speedup over the traditional algorithms. (Project page: EFIT-AI)
  - Developed autotuning framework to explore a tree‑like search space based on Monte Carlo tree search; obtained 3.7x speedup over the default heuristic optimizations on Exascale proxy apps; collaborated with experts on compiler optimization for HPC. [code] [tutorial]
  - Designed autotuning framework for online settings based on transfer learning; provided a hands‑on tutorial. [code] [tutorial]
  - Maintained a ML based autotuning software package (Ytopt); provided tutorial examples of HPC proxy apps; available in Spack.
  - Helped X‑ray scientists by designing corrector algorithm in Tensorflow to clean noisy images from dark‑field X‑ray microscope based on a CNN for optical flow (PWC‑Net).
  - Helped materials scientists using a distributed hyperparameter search software (DeepHyper) to autotune configurations of neuromorphic computing architectures under extreme environments
